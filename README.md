# Hello, I'm Erin!

### About Me
I will write an about me here that will also go on linked in.

This GitHub portfolio details the Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence works that I have completed throughout my career. Please take a look around!

## Projects

### Red Light, Green Light: Dynamic Traffic Lights Using Reinforcement Learning
Click to view: 

In this project, I collaborated with a teammate to optimize traffic flow at our University's Medical Campus located in downtown Buffalo, NY. We did this by developing custom RL agents from scratch, including Q-Learning, SARSA, and Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN), as well as utilizing a PPO agent from Stable-Baselines3. We trained our agents on a single intersection first, and then transferred the most effective agents to the University at Buffalo Medical Campus intersections. Our work demonstrated significant traffic efficiency improvements through simulations and showcased our results at UB's CSE Demo Days. 

### Deep Learning for Diabetes Detection Using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks

Alongside a team of three, we built a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) from scratch to detect diabetes in patients. The model's performance was benchmarked against a standard multi-layer perceptron and the official KAN implementation. Our research demonstrated the crucial role that a KAN model can play in a healthcare setting due to its high performance and high-quality interpretability.

### Analysis of Food Store Accessibility in Erie County, New York
Click to view:

For this project, I used retail food store and income data from Erie County to build a database from scratch using SQLite. I first conducted an exploratory analysis to view common trends throughout the county of access to food stores in relation to the average income of the area. I applied a decision tree to make predictions ___. My findings were presented in a Python dashboard.
