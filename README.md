# Hello, I'm Erin!

### About Me
I am a recent graduate from the University at Buffalo, where I earned my Master’s degree in Data Science and Applications. Over the course of my studies, I’ve developed a strong foundation not only in Data Science, but also in related areas such as Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Database Management, and Cybersecurity. I am thankful to have prioritized gaining such a well-rounded and versatile technical skill set.

Currently, I’m completing a Data Analytics internship with the National STEM Honor Society. As part of the E-commerce team, I leverage Python, R, and SQL to extract, analyze, and communicate key business insights. It is rewarding to know that I am helping NSTEM connect students all across the world with access to their STEM resources. 

Now, I’m actively seeking a full-time role where I can bring my analytical mindset, technical expertise, and enthusiasm for learning to a collaborative team, making a meaningful impact every day.

This GitHub portfolio details the Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence works that I have completed throughout my career. Also, view my resume [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EbZTzoaMiwoH3PZ3R7mANGSvEh3O_-SG/view?usp=sharing). Please take a look around!

## Projects

### Red Light, Green Light: Dynamic Traffic Lights Using Reinforcement Learning
Click to view: [DynamicTrafficLightsWithRL](https://github.com/egregoire23/DynamicTrafficLightsWithRL)

In this project, I collaborated with a teammate to optimize traffic flow at the University at Buffalo Medical Campus. We developed custom RL agents from scratch, including Q-Learning, SARSA, and Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN), as well as implementing PPO from Stable-Baselines3. Our models were trained on a single intersection, then transferred to real intersections in the medical campus. We showcased significant traffic efficiency improvements through simulations and presented our work at UB’s CSE Demo Days.

### Deep Learning for Diabetes Detection Using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks

As part of a team of three, we implemented a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) from scratch to detect diabetes in patients. We benchmarked its performance against both a standard multi-layer perceptron and the official KAN implementation. The KAN model demonstrated strong performance and offered excellent interpretability for healthcare applications.

### Exploring CNN Architectures for Image Classification

To demonstrate my skills in deep learning and building convolutional neural networks, I recreated the VGG-16 and ResNet-18 from scratch using the original research papers as guidelines. The models were trained, evaluated, and compared using images of dogs, food, and vehicles.

### Sentiment Analysis with Transformers

My team and I implemented an Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) reinforcement learning agent and evaluated its performance on the Lunar Lander and Bipedal Walker environments from OpenAI Gymnasium.

### Analysis of Food Store Accessibility in Erie County, New York
Click to view: [AnalysisOfFoodStoreAccessibility](https://github.com/egregoire23/AnalysisOfFoodStoreAccessibility)

Using SQLite, I created a database from retail food store and income data in Erie County. I conducted exploratory data analysis to understand food accessibility in relation to income levels and used decision trees to classify a zipcode as either city or suburb. Results were visualized in a Python dashboard.
